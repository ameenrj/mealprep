# meal-prep

Meal Prep is a simple SPA built to explore using Vue.js, Vuex, Vuetify and Firebase together. 

Users can select select one of three meal plans which grab 9 recipes from [Edamam's](https://www.edamam.com/) recipe search API. Users can then add recipes to their profile provided they have signed into their account.
